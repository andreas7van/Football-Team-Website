                In the first match for 2024, our team faced the very strong @atletico_bobonieras. In the first quarter, our team was lost in the field and thus conceded the first goal very early, making it 0-1 for the opponents, a score that remained until first half . In the second half she picked up the pace, this was helped by the entry of @_hgiann_ on the pitch. So the equalizer came from our captain @vasilhs_christopoulos at the beginning of the second half and the game then became a draw with both teams explaining well @vasilhs_christopoulos to take the rebound after a shot by @_hgiann_ and write 2-1 a score which the team managed and kept until the end of the match.
                
                We wish good luck to our opponents and thank once again our fans who came to the stadium and honored us with their presenceüü£‚ö´Ô∏è!</p>

            <p>9:00 PM at Thunders Sports Arena</p>
            <p>In an impressive game in terms of spectacle, our team was defeated with a score of 7-10 in Agios Antonios where they played for the first time. Although our team led the game in the first phase of the game with @giorgos_papanikolo in the continuation of the game he managed to find himself behind the score in the first quarter with a wide score of 1-4 which had never happened for the our team this year. Although our team continued to try to equalize, they were constantly conceding goals even though they had constant reactions, but they did not manage to beat the very strong @asteiatores_fc

                Many thanks to @asteiatores_fc for the very strong match and we wish them good success in the continuation of the event
                
                Finally, we would like to apologize for the image of our team which was not the expected one.
                
                We continue strongüü£‚ö´Ô∏è</p>
